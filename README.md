# PirateSoftware Game Jam 15

## Description

This repository contains all the data, resources, and files generated during the PirateSoftwareGameJam2024 that I participated in. A game jam is an event where game developers come together to create a game from scratch within a limited time frame, this one lasted 14 days. The goal is to encourage creativity, collaboration, and learning among participants.

The PirateSoftwareGameJam2024 main theme was "Shadows and Alchemy", which served as inspiration for the games created during the event.
